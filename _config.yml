  I live in Brooklyn and work at Kinderhook partners, a long-only global investment fund. Investing captured my interest after seeing the dramatic movements in biotech stock prices after FDA decisions were announced. Over time, I have gradually gravitated towards companies with far more predictable and durable growth or companies approaching inflection points. I am sector agnostic, though I have become an Aerospace nerd while covering it on the sell-side at SIG.

  I graduated UC Berkeley with a double major in Economics and Interdisciplinary Studies (my own program of psych/history/sociology) and wrote my thesis about chess. Concurrent with my undergraduate education, I became a decent baker, and have been working tirelessly to perfect the convection oven pizza.

  Below are some stocks I have liked at a point in time. I have owned all except for Doric, which was too illiquid, even for me.
