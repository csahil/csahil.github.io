Vital Farms (VITL) wants you to think that they're a  CPG company despite selling a commodity  with their brand on it. Either way, this is a short. There's no path to capture the share of the market they need to justify their valuation. 2021 will have catalyst after catalyst - partly due to competition on the shelf of Whole Foods by Amazon, who, a year ago, was their biggest benefactor.
