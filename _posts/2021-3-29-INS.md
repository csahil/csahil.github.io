Intelligent Systems (INS) operates the CoreCard platform, used to issue and manage credit cards - most notably the Apple Card via Goldman Sachs. I don't think that it's out of the question that they can 10x their revenues in the next 10 years. And, given their current reasonable valuation, that should 10x the stock price.
