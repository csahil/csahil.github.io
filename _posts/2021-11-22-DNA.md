Doric Nimrod Air (DNA.L) is one airplane that's far too cheap when compared to the exact same airplane. I never ended up buying this ass it was too thinly traded but did miss out on a +70% buyout by Emirates for 25mn pounds, slightly more than the price implied by DNA2 and DNA3 at the time of the writeup (see model).
