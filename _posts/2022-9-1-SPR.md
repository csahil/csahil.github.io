Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) faced two black-swan(-ish) events, first with the grounding of the 737 MAX, which was almost 50% of the company' business, and then the cessation of global travel, which was 90% of company profit. Sprit is still coming out of the crisis in better shape, without having to issue equity and with a clear path to tackling 2025's maturities. The stock has the potential to more than double based on largely spoken-for trends, mostly faced with the risk of more delays (vs. demand destruction).
