Phreesia (PHR) provides patient intake software. Despite presenting as a SaaS business, the company employs a beachhead strategy, with advertising ("Have you asked your doctor about XYZator?") being the real money maker. This was successful over the past few years as COVID and a lack of competition aiding the massive S&M spend.

I like the business, but it's clear that it is deteriorating. I see it playing out like this:
1. Customer Acquisition Cost grows steadily to pre-COVID levels, reflecting less greenfield, less need, and more competition.
2. Management tries to hide this through acquisitions that aid KPIs but do little for the business. [We are here now.]
3. These worsening trends are made apparent through 2024, indicating that growth expectations are far too high in out years.
4. The stock goes down.
